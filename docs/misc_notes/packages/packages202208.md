## Machine Learning Essential Packages - Aug 2022

*Aug 6, 2022*

`*` indicates packages newly added to the lists.

####  The bascis

The basic packages for data processing, mathematical and scitific calculations.


| Package | Description | 
| ------  | ------      |
| [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) | data analysis and manipulation.  read/write excel/csv/compressed files, process data, and plot ugly graphs| 
| [numpy](https://numpy.org/) |  mathematical functions, random number generators, linear algebra routines. | 
| [scipy](https://scipy.org/ ) | optimization, integration, interpolation, eigenvalue problems, algebraic equations, differential equations, statistics | 

####  The core

**A few more notes**

- Tabnet wheel file can be downloaded from here:
 > https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/94/e5/2a808d611a5d44e3c997c0d07362c04a56c70002208e00aec9eee3d923b5/pytorch_tabnet-3.1.1-py3-none-any.whl
- You may need to upgrade pip first in order to isntall *Scrapy* successfully. 
- tsfresh: *tsfresh==0.17.0* requires "statsmodels==0.10.2", higher version of statsmodels will lead to error. 
- Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable
> - DLL load failure may occur if it is not installed.
> - It can be downloaded at https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe
