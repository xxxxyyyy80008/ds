It is very important to download a file that matches with your python version. Otherwise the installation will fail.
For example, my python version is 3.6, so I downloaded the whl file with 36 in file name.

If you download the file that does not match with your python version, you will get error message. For example, I have Python 3.7 on another machine and I tried a few files.
