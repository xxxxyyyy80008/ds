### Summary of advanced feature selection methods - Jul 2022

1. **SPSA-FSR: Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation for Feature Selection and Ranking - An Introduction and Accuracy Performance Comparison with Other Wrapper Methods** by  *Zeren D. Yenice, Niranjan Adhikari, Yong Kai Wong, Vural Aksakalli, Alev Taskin Gumus, Babak Abbasi* [16 Apr 2018]

    - [paper fulltext in pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.05589v1.pdf)
    - [implementaion with examples in python](https://github.com/akmand/spFSR)
        
1. **PPFS: Predictive Permutation Feature Selection** by *Atif Hassan, Jiaul H. Paik, Swanand Khare, Syed Asif Hassan* [20 Oct 2021]
    - [paper with code url](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/ppfs-predictive-permutation-feature-selection)
    - [paper fulltext in pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.10713v1.pdf)
    - [implementaion with examples in python](https://github.com/atif-hassan/PyImpetus)
    > - it is a **wrapper-based feature selection method** based on the concept of **Markov Blanket (MB)**. 
    > - it can work for both classification and regression tasks on datasets containing categorical and/or continuous features. 
    > - *according to the authors*, the PPFS outperforms state-of-the-art Markov blanket discovery algorithms and well-known wrapper methods.
