###   7. Combo Charts -  Mistake: Truncating the scale


<span style="color:FireBrick; font-size:12pt; font-weight : bold;">Example 1</Span>

[This chart](https://www.economist.com/britain/2016/08/13/the-metamorphosis) shows the average number of Facebook likes on posts by pages of the political left. The point of this chart was to show the disparity between Mr Corbyn’s posts and others.
The original chart not only downplays the number of Mr Corbyn’s likes but also exaggerates those on other posts. In the redesigned version, we show Mr Corbyn’s bar in its entirety. All other bars remain visible.
