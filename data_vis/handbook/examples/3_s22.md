**When Did Ebola Arrive and Spread at a Dallas Hospital?**

Thomas Eric Duncan, a Liberian who traveled to Dallas, began developing symptoms for Ebola on Sept. 19 and tested positive for Ebola six days later. Two nurses, Nina Pham and Amber Joy Vinson, were caring for Mr. Duncan during what federal health officials have called the highest risk period, when he was vomiting and experiencing diarrhea. Both nurses tested positive for Ebola after Mr. Duncan died.

Ms. Pham and Ms. Vinson were transported to special isolation units in Atlanta and Maryland. Both have since recovered from the disease.
