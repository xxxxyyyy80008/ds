<span style="color:orange; ">**How Many People Could Become Infected? **</span>

The W.H.O. reported on Oct. 14 that the number of new Ebola cases <span style="color:orange; ">could reach 10,000 per week</span> by December. The C.D.C. published a report in September that outlined a worst-case situation, in which the total number of cases could reach 1.4 million in four months. The C.D.C.’s model is based on data from August and includes cases in Liberia and Sierra Leone, but not Guinea (where counts have been unreliable). It also projects further into the future and adds ranges to account for underreporting of cases.

Use span charts when you’ve only got the min and max (not a median, mean, or frequency count).
